### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning Systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NLP to improve university systems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on analytics and AI areas.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with autoregressive neural networks to my master degree.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about machine learning systems, dashboards, Rest APIs, analytics maturity curve and descriptive, predictive, prescriptive problems.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sergiomora823@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: always -> '*our* system'.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know a joke with Python, but I think this isn't the environment. ::smile:: âœ¨
